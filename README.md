## Introduction

The Smart Healthcare System is a simple project aimed at demonstrating basic concepts in C programming. It allows users to interact with the system as either an admin or a regular user. The admin can manage healthcare-related information, while the user can access and utilize those features.

## Prerequisites

Before running the Smart Healthcare System on your computer, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Code Blocks** (or any other C compiler)
2. **C Standard Library**

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rafiqul-jakir/Smart-Healthcare-System.git
```

2. Open the project in Code Blocks (or your preferred C compiler).

3. Build the project to generate the executable.

## Default User and Admin Details

The Smart Healthcare System comes with default user and admin credentials. You can use the following details to log in:

**Default User:**
- Username: Sanzida
- Password: sanzida

**Default Admin:**
- Username: Rafiqul
- Password: jakir

Please note that for security reasons, it's essential to change the default credentials once you start using the system in a production environment. You can modify the authentication mechanism in the code to allow users to set their passwords upon first login or implement a more secure login method.


## Usage

1. Run the compiled executable.

2. You will be presented with a command prompt interface that offers options for admin and user functionalities.

3. Choose the appropriate role (admin or user) and follow the prompts to navigate through the system.

4. Use the options available to perform various healthcare-related tasks.

5. Once done, exit the system.
